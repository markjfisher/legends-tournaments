As an admin I would like to create tournaments with a name and set of rules

As an admin I would like rules to match the following types

  - by constraining the total number of cards in a deck
  - by constraining the colour/house of cards allowed in deck (drop down list of all combinations)
  - by constraining the count of each rarity
  - by constraining the count of each type (Creature, support, etc.)
  - by constraining which cards can be used for a particular type (Creature, support, etc.)

As a user I would like to enter my deck code for a particular tournament and
verify it is valid

As an admin I would like to be able to capture the players of a tournament
and record their decks.
